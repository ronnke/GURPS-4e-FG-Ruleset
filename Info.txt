Please report any bugs, errors.

You can export and import (player characters only) from the previous ruleset. You can also import PCs/NPCs using the currently available GCA export to FG created by Saithan.

One feature which is not obviously clear, you can drag and drop [I]Skills [/I] onto the attributes at the top of the skills section. This will perform an attribute based skill role using the skill's relative levels. eg To do an IQ based, [I]Guns[/I] roll, to un-jam a rifle, simply drag and drop the appropriate skill onto the IQ box. 

Enjoy.
